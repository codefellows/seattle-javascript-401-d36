## DSA: Final

- Ashley: What do our assignment look like?
  - It really depends.
- David: Once we determine the problem domain.
  - Can we have some gotchas and intrusive throughts?
- Marlene: Round 2 of whiteboarding?
  - Jacob: You will be messaged very soon ( next couple of days )

- Look at a prompt from a Code Challenge 38.
  - Create a function that accepts an adjacency list as a graph, and conducts a depth first traversal. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return a collection of nodes in their pre-order depth-first traversal order.

- Adjancency list : all the list of vetices of a graph.
  - depth first traversal.
    - we need to go visit all neighboring nodes from a start point.
    - before we move to adjacent neighbors we need to visit all children.
  - what do you mean by collection, return nodes. it doesn't really the collection..
  - Pre-order.
    - Left most ordering.

# LAB - Typescript Module

Create your first native typescript module using skills gained from a previously javascript projects. Over the course of the nest two days we will be building a small full stack application that can send chat messages back and forth to clients in real time.

## Before you begin

Refer to *Getting Started*  in the [lab submission instructions](../../../reference/submission-instructions/labs/README.md) for complete setup, configuration, deployment, and submission instructions.

Create a new GitHub repository titled with your course code and this lab number (i.e. js-401n15-class-10)

You will be submitting the URL to the README (docs) at the root of this repository for your assignment.

## Assignment

Over the next two day, you will create your first full stack Typescript App.  We will working to produce a real messaging system that can allow client applicatoin to connect to a server via web sockets.  

### Requirements

#### Milestone 1 - Messaging API

- Build a basic Messaging system.
- A list of messages should be stored and modified runtime memory ( no database ) for your application.
- Implement socket events for 'connection', 'message', and 'disconnect'.
  - Your server should be able to emit and respond appropriatly to socket events.
- Messages must be defined using a typescript interface.
- At least one http endpoint should be used to request information about your server.

### Milestone 2 - React Interface

### Documentation

For this assignment, instead of writing developer documentation, write end user documentation.

"How do I use this application"

We recommend using the "Steve Jobs" standards, which is to say that your app should be so easy to use and should do such an obvious thing that documentation isn't required.

That said ... it's required. Shoot for the Jobs standard, but document this like you're going to sell it on the *App Store* (you might)

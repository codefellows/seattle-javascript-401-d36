# Class 38

## Warm Up

- Split into two teams, building Redux store for messages
  - Store must store object that look like this:
    - { text, createdAt, author } - all of these are strings.
  - One team (Paul, Dave, Ashley), is going to create a all the components needed to talk to a redux store.
    - Provider
    - "Connected" component
  - Another team (David, Marlene, and maybe Garhett), will create the store, reducer, and some actions
    - Initial state
    - Reducer
    - Actions
      - send (add messages to the store)
      - fetch (gets alll messages from the store)

## Async Actions in Redux

## Testing our actions and reducers
- Testing the reducer is super easy.
- Testing async actions is now important.
